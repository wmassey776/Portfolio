## Tech/framework used
Python 3.9.5


## Instructions
**Binary Search** begins by searching a sorted array and repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. 
The algorithm begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the `target_number` is less than the
`middle_index`, it narrows the interval to the `lower half`. Otherwise, it narrows it to the `upper half`. Repeatedly
this process until the target_number is found, or the interval is empty.
