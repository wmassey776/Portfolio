## Rules of Pig Latin

The rules to Pig Latin are simple:

1. If a word begins with a consonant then move the first letter of the word to the end of the word and add "ay."
   - _Example: Happy = appyh + ay = appyhay_

2. If a word begins with two consonants then move the two consonants to the end of the word and add "ay."<br>
   - _Example: Child = Ildch + ay = Ildchay_

3. If a word begins with a vowel add the word "way" at the end of the word.
   - _Example: Apple = Apple + way = Appleway_
   

## Instructions
1. Start the program
2. Enter a word or phrase
3. The program will translate the input into Pig Latin.
